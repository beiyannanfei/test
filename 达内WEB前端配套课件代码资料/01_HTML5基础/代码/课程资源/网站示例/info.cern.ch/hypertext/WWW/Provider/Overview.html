<NEXTID 20>
<H1>Information Provider</H1>There are many ways of making your new or existing data available
on the <A NAME=13 HREF=%22../TheProject.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">"web"</A> . The best method depends on what sort of data you have.
(If you have any questions, mail the www team at www-bug@info.cern.ch.).

<H2>You have plain text files</H2>If you have some plain text files then you can easily write, or generate
using a script,  a small hypertext file which points to them.  To
make them accessible you can use either <A NAME=2 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/AnonymousFTP.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is linked too far away from its Starting Address.

daemon</A> .  
<H2>You have a NeXT</H2>You can use our prototype <A NAME=8 HREF=%22../NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/NeXT/WorldWideWeb.html">hypertext editor</A> to create a web of hypertext,
linking it to existing files. This is not YET available for X11 workstations.
This is a fast way of making online documentation, as well as performing
the hyper-librarian job of making sure all your information can be
found.
<H2><A NAME=14>Using a shell script</A></H2>An HTTP daemon is such a simple thing that a simple shell script will
often suffice. This is great for bits of information available locally
through other programs, which you would like to publish. More deatils
on writing servers using <A NAME=11 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html">shell scripts under unix</A> , or<A NAME=17 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/DCLServer.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/DCLServer.html%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/DCLServer.html"> in DCL under
VMS</A> .
<H2>You have many files</H2>In this case, for speed of access, the <A NAME=4 HREF=%22../Daemon/User/Guide.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Guide.html">HTTP daemon</A> will probably be
best. You can write a tree of hypertext in <A NAME=7 HREF=%22../MarkUp/MarkUp.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML</A> linking the text files,
or you can even generate the tree automatically from your directory
tree.  If you want to generate a full-text index, then you could use
the public domain <A NAME=5 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/WAIS/Overview.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is linked too far away from its Starting Address. If you increase the in-domain depth setting for the Starting Address, this file will be queued for retrieval.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/WAIS/Overview.html%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/WAIS/Overview.html">WAIS</A> software - your data will then be accessible
(as plain text, not hypertext) through the <A NAME=9 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/WAISGate.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/WAISGate.html%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/WAISGate.html">WAIS gateway</A> .
<H2>You have an existing information base</H2>If you have a maintained base of information, don't rush into changing
the way you manage it.  A "gateway" W3 server can run on top of your
existing system, making the information in it available to the world.
This is how it works:
<UL>
<LI>Menus map onto sets of hypertext links
<LI>Different search options map onto different "index" document addresses
(even if they use the same index underneath in your system).
<LI>Procedures used by those who contribute and manage information stay
unaltered.
</UL>If your database is WAIS,  VMS/HELP, XFIND, or Hyper-G, a gateway
exists already. These gateway servers did not take long to write.
You can pick up a skeleton server in C from our <A NAME=6 HREF=%22../../README.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/README.html">distribution</A> . You
can also write one from scratch, for example in perl <A NAME=16 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/ShellScript.html">or sh</A> .  An advantage
of a gateway is that you can maintain your existing procedures for
creating text and managing the database.  For more information, see:<P>
