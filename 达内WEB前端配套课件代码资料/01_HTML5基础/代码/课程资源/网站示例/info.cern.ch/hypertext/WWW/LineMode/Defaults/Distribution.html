<H1>Getting the WWW files</H1>Read this if you have not yet got the WWW files you need, and you
cannot NFS mount a directory on which they reside.<P>
 The source and binary of WWW project files are currently available
(see <A NAME=1 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Copyright.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Copyright.html%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Copyright.html">copyright</A> ) by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch.  This node
is currently 128.141.201.74 but THIS MAY CHANGE. The files are compressed
tape archive files (.tar.Z).  To get  a file using anonymous FTP,
use user name "anonymous", and your email address as a password:-
<XMP>			> ftp info.cern.ch
			Enter user name: anonymous
			Password: me@myhost.edu
			ftp> cd /pub/www/src
			ftp> binary
			ftp> get WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z
			ftp> quit
			>

</XMP>The file name will depend on the product you want.  Here vvv is the
version number of the software.<P>
Once you have the compressed tar file, you must uncompress it and
unwrap it.
<XMP>			uncompress WWWLineMode_vvv.tar.Z

</XMP>This will make a rather larger file with the name without the ".Z".
To unwrap it,
<XMP>			tar xvf WWWLineMode_vvv.tar
