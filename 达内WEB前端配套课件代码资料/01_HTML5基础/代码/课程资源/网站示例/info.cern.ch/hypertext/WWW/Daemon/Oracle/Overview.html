<H1>Oracle server</H1>This was written during August and September 1992 by <A NAME=6 HREF=%22../../People.html#17%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/People.html#17">Arthur Secret</A>.<P>
The server takes a W3 query as an SQL SELECT staement and returns
the results formatted as a table in plain text.<P>
This server is obviously a good sarting point for a gateway to provide
a hypertext view of an oracle database.
<H2>Sources</H2>The normal daemon files from the basic W3 daemon and library are used,
and also:

<DD>The clue to how it is built, with lists of W3 and oracle libraries.
(Not all the Oracle libraries mentioned are necessarily used).
