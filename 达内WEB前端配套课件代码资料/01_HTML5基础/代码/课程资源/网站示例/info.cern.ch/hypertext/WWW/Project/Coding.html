<H1>Coding Standards</H1>This document describes a coding style for C code (and therefore largely
for C++ and Objective-C code). The style is used by the W3 project
used so that:-
<UL>
<LI>Code is portable and maintainable.
<LI>Code is easily readable by other project members.
</UL>If you have suggestions, do send them. (We do not include points designed
to allow automatic processing of code by parsers with an incomplete
awareness of C syntax.).   IF YOU DO NOT ABIDE BY THIS GUIDE YOUR
CODE WILL ANNOY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS AND MAY NOT PORT.<P>
The style guide is divided into sections on <A NAME=1 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Project/Language.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is linked too far away from its Starting Address.
