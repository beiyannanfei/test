The <A NAME=6 HREF=%22User/Guide.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Guide.html">command line syntax</A> is the same as for the normal W3 daemon, except
that a rule file is not used. (No -r or -R options).<P>

<H2>WSRC files</H2>The gateway keeps a cache of WAIS "source" files. These are files<P>
describing WAIS servers. They are normally picked up automatically
by searching a "directory of servers" index. Once the gateway has
picked up a desciption of  a server,  it uses the description to describe
the server to those who follow links to it.<P>
These source files are converted into hypertext, and are kept in the
directory /usr/local/lib/WAIS under the server name, port, and database
name.<P>
To add an extra source file to this cache by hand, feed it as standard
input to the ParseWSRC program.<P>
