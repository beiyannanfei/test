<DD> We did this with the "WWW Book" to print it.

<DT>Server log analysis
<DD> Analysing server logs requires first of all changing
the numeric internet node numebrs into domain names. <A NAME=7 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/LogAnalysis/httpd-analyse.c  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/LogAnalysis/httpd-analyse.c%27%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Tools/LogAnalysis/httpd-analyse.c">httpd-analyse.c</A>
