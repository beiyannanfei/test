<NEXTID 6>
<H1>VMS Help server</H1>This server can provide WWW users with any information stored in VMS
Help format. It currently runs on ONLINE as an experimental service
to access standard VMS Help topics. We plan to install this server
on VXCERN and other machines to access data stored in the VMS Help
system by various CERN Experiment Groups.
