<LI>Some (like CONCISE and CERN's ALICE) require logging on to Ð inconvenient
<LI>Few, if any, use hypertext now.
<LI>Some could be used as a base for a hypertext system or a source of
data for <A NAME=5 HREF=%22TheProject.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">WWW</A> .

<H2>Specific hypertext systems</H2>
<UL>
<LI>E.g. Framemaker, <A NAME=2 HREF=%22../Products/Overview.html#19%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/Overview.html#19">Hypercard</A> , etc. 
<LI>Not networked very well, in that all browsers must share a file system.
(HEP in ten year's time?). 
<LI>Text is not portable between applications, and applications cannot
interwork.
<LI>Platform support often limited to one supplier.

<LI>E.g. <A NAME=3 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/DynaText/Overview.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is linked too far away from its Starting Address.

<LI>Can handle many formats, and SGML DTDs. Some allow scripts to be written
for document retrieval, and so may be extendable in the WWW direction.
<LI>Still based on a  single file system.
