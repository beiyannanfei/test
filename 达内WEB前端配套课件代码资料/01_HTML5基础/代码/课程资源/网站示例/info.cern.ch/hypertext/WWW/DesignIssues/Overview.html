<NEXTID 20>
<H1>Design Issues</H1>This lists decisions to be made in the design or selection of a <A NAME=12 HREF=%22../WhatIs.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/WhatIs.html">hypermedia</A>
information system. It assumes familiarity with   the concept of hypertext.
A summary of the uses of hypertext systems is followed by a list of
features which may or may not be available.  Some of the points appear
in the Comms ACM July 88 articles on various hypertext systems.  Some
points were discussed also at <A NAME=11 HREF=%22javascript:if(confirm(%27http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Conferences/ECHT90/Points.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is linked too far away from its Starting Address.

Tentative answers to some design
decisions from the CERN perspective are included.<P>
