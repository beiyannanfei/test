<H1>A Shell Server for HTTP</H1>The HTTP protocol is very simple. The following is an example of a
server program written in sh:
<XMP>#! /bin/sh
read get docid
echo "<TITLE>$docid</TITLE>"
echo Here is the data

</XMP>The docid may have a trailing carriage return to be stripped off on
some systems. You can modify that script to produce the data you actually
want. The <A NAME=1 HREF=%22../MarkUp/MarkUp.html%22 tppabs="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML</A> syntax for marked-up text is fairly simple, but if
you want just to send plain text, then just send the  &lt.PLAINTEXT&gt.
tag first:
<XMP>#! /bin/sh
read get docid
echo "<PLAINTEXT>"
cat $docid

</XMP>When you have written your script, set the execute bit and then configure
