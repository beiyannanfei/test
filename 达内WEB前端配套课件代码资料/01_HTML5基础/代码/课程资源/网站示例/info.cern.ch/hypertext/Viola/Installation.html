beta-test
<H2>Files you need</H2>Using anonymous FTP, pick up the tar file ViolaWWW_920515.tar.Z from
the /pub/www/src directory on info.cern.ch. Uncompress it and un tar
it. You will get a new directory ViolaWWW_920515 under which you will
find the apps directory and a bin directory (and a src directory you
don't need) Write a small shell script like
<XMP>
#! /bin/csh
/.../bin/viola.decstation -path /.../apps &
</XMP>Call this script vw, give it execute mode
<XMP>
                      chmod +x vw

</XMP>and put it into some directory which is in your path (like your own
bin or /usr/local/bin if you can be root). Of course in the script
above replace the ... with the actual path name of wherever you have
put the viola files. Type
<XMP>
  rehash
</XMP>so that your shell knows about the new command. That's all I think
you need to do. Just type
<XMP>
   vw
</XMP>When the application starts, click on the big question-mark for help.
